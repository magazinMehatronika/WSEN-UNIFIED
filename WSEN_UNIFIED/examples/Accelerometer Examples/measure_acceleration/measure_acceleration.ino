/*

  WSEN-ITDS - Read Sensor 


  This example reads the acceleration values along all axes
  from the WSEN-ITDS sensor in the high performance mode.
  
  The SAO pin is here connected to the logic high level. 
  The initialization by the ODR and the full scale needs to 
  be performed at first.
  The acceleration values are printed on the serial monitor.
