  WSEN-PADS - Read Sensor


  This example reads the temperature and the pressure from the WSEN-PADS sensor in
  the continuous mode. 
  The low-noise configuration and the additional low pass filter are enabled.

  The SAO pin is connected to positive supply voltage.

  The temperature is printed in °C and the pressure in kPa on the serial monitor.
